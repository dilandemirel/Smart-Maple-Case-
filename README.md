Connecting to PostgreSQL and Creating Tables with Docker Compose:
I successfully connected to the PostgreSQL database using the Docker Compose file. Then, I created the necessary fields and tables in the database. This allowed me to set up a proper structure to store the data in an organized manner.

Scraping All Campground Data and Storing it in the Database:
I scraped data for all campgrounds across the United States from The Dyrt's map interface. I used the latitude and longitude data that appeared as the mouse moved on the map, and stored each campgroundâ€™s data in the PostgreSQL database.

Data Validation Using Pydantic:
I validated the data using pydantic for model validation. I checked the required fields from src/models/campground.py to ensure that the data matched the required structure, and only valid data was stored in the database.

Updating Existing Records:
I detected and updated any existing records in the database. This way, instead of adding new data every time, I ensured that the database was consistently updated with changes to existing records.

Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:
I implemented a comprehensive error handling strategy for HTTP errors and other potential issues. Additionally, I added a retry mechanism to ensure that the scraping process continued smoothly without interruption, even when errors occurred.
